# Analyzing-TV-Data
In this project, I have loaded, cleaned, then explored Super Bowl game, television, and halftime show data. Visualized the distributions of combined points, point differences, and halftime show performances using histograms. Line plots to see how ad cost increases lagged behind viewership increases are used.
